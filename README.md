Problem Statement :

1. Event Order Challenge: In Scratch, events trigger code blocks. Can you explain the order in which events are processed when multiple sprites are involved in a project, and how can you control the event order for specific scenarios?

2. Broadcasting Puzzle: Imagine you have two sprites that need to communicate using broadcasts. How would you ensure that the sprites receive the broadcast messages in the correct sequence, even if one sprite's code runs faster than the other's?

3. Variable Scoping Riddle: Explain the concept of variable scope in Scratch and provide an example where understanding variable scope is crucial to achieving the desired behavior of a project. How can you address issues related to variable scope?

4. Create a program that can translate text from one language to another.

5. Write a program to play a game of rock, paper, scissors.

6. Write a program to simulate a coin toss.

7. Write a program to generate a random number.

8. Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

9. Write a program to find the factorial of a number.

10. Write a program to check whether a number is prime.
